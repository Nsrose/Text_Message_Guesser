Text_Message_Guesser
====================

Have you ever received a text that you had absolutely no idea what the other person really meant? 
This is a common problem with texting/IMing. All we see is the text, when 93% of communication is nonverbal. Just how
bad are we at determining each others' emotions through text? 


This is a short game that you play with one other person. Each person selects which emotion best fits the text shown, 
without looking at each other's selection. After 20 texts, the program returns how many you and your partner agreed on. 

I have preloaded a set of 20 commonly sent text messages. Some are ambiguous, some are not. In the future, I'd like to make
this into a GWAP that helps computers determine the prevailing emotion behind a text message.
